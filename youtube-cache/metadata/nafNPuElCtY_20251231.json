  "description": "I built a complete design system\u2014from Figma to production code\u2014in 4 hours using AI. Here's the exact workflow I use.\n\nYour team takes 2 weeks to ship a dashboard feature. Teams with design systems ship the same feature in 2 hours. The problem? Building a design system used to require months of dedicated engineering time. After working with 50+ B2B SaaS product teams, I've refined a one-afternoon workflow using Claude Code and Cursor that gets you from Figma design system to shipping features the same day.\n\nThis isn't just about generating components\u2014this is the complete strategic workflow: style guide extraction, component library building, and shipping real features.\n\nWhat You'll Learn: \n\u2022 The exact prompts I use to generate production-ready components \n\u2022 Why you should build your style guide BEFORE components \n\u2022 The notes.md workflow that documents everything automatically \n\u2022 Real examples of 2-3x development speed increases\n\nThe Results: \nTeams with design systems report 38% improvement in product development efficiency, 40% faster time-to-market, and 34% faster task completion. This tutorial shows you how to achieve those numbers in one afternoon, not three months.\n\nNeed help implementing design systems for your product team?
