  "title": "I Built an Award-Winning Website in 15 Minutes using Google's Antigravity (0 Coding)",
  "description": "Most creative agencies would charge $50,000+ for a 3D \"Scrollytelling\" landing page. Today, I built one in under 15 minutes, completely for free.\nIn this video, I\u2019m testing Google\u2019s new Agentic IDE, Antigravity. We aren't just generating code; we are building a full asset pipeline. I\u2019ll show you how to generate consistent product keyframes with Google Whisk, animate them with Google Flow, and use a dual-agent workflow (Gemini 3.0 + Claude 4.5) to write production-ready Next.js & Framer Motion code.\nIf you are still manually coding scroll animations in 2026, you are working too hard.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 THE PROMPT & PROJECT FILES:\nGet the exact System Prompt, asset workflow, and code snippets here:\n\ud83d\udc49 https://www.notion.so/I-Built-an-Award-Winning-Website-in-15-Minutes-0-Coding-2d6fab5f074a8019bf1aed4fd2354922\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f TOOLS USED:\nGoogle Antigravity (IDE)\nGoogle Whisk (Image Generation)\nGoogle Flow (Video Generation)\nEzgif (Sequence Conversion)\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f TIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 - The Result (Zenith X Exploded View)\n0:57 - Generating Consistent Keyframes (Whisk)\n2:15 - AI Motion & Physics (Flow)\n2:55 - Converting for Web Performance(Ezgif)\n3:41 - The Antigravity Build (Gemini 3.0)\n4:18 - Final Result & Code Audit\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 MUSIC:\nBlue Boi by LAKEY INSPIRED\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0\n\n\ud83d\udc4b ABOUT ME:\nI'm Sameer.
